  (p "
I've started my first Guile Scheme app. It is a small generator
of blog. You can see the result this small post that I wrote here.")
  (p "
I thought about writing small app to learn Scheme - Lisp derivative.
I was aquainted already with Clojure (another Lisp derivative), so
parenthesis and list wasn't novelty for me, but it was not what
I expected. It wasn't bad, but it meant getting used to another idea
for the development, different toolset and libraries.")
  (p "
I know that there are other, more sophisticated Scheme implementations
like Racket, but Guile felt to me lighter and the module system was more
like I was used to already. There was even a HTTP client and server in
the standard library :).")
  (p "
GNU Guile is available almost in every Linux distribution and on MacOS X.
It is just one command to install it:")
